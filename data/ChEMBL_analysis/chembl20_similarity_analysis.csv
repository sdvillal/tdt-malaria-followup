Each MMV compound (0.1 mM) was tested in minimal media containing dextrose as a carbon source (Yeast Nitrogen Base, Dextrose; YNBD). The growth rate in the presence of each MMV compound was calculated as follows: (i) the first 10 OD readings were averaged and subtracted from all OD readings of the corresponding curve to set the baseline of the growth curve to zero, and (ii) the area under the curve (AUC) was then calculated as the sum of all OD readings. AUC was calculated following 80 OD readings, corresponding to roughly 20 h of growth. A “relative growth” value was calculated as follows: (AUCDRUG – AUCDMSO)/AUCDMSO; where AUCDMSO represents growth measured in a DMSO control well that was on the same microtiter plate of the drug-treated culture. A relative growth value near zero means the compound had little or no effect on growth, whereas a value near -1 means the compound strongly or completely inhibited growth.","F","In vitro",,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,,,,,50347,"N",1,"Autocuration",17,"2","CHEMBL3301548","ORGANISM","Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",0,81,126,,"A Active",1.0,0.36,0.35,0.37,1731000,"ENAMINE","Z56833758"

Each MMV compound (0.1 mM) was tested in minimal media containing dextrose as a carbon source (Yeast Nitrogen Base, Dextrose; YNBD). The growth rate in the presence of each MMV compound was calculated as follows: (i) the first 10 OD readings were averaged and subtracted from all OD readings of the corresponding curve to set the baseline of the growth curve to zero, and (ii) the area under the curve (AUC) was then calculated as the sum of all OD readings. AUC was calculated following 80 OD readings, corresponding to roughly 20 h of growth. A “relative growth” value was calculated as follows: (AUCDRUG – AUCDMSO)/AUCDMSO; where AUCDMSO represents growth measured in a DMSO control well that was on the same microtiter plate of the drug-treated culture. A relative growth value near zero means the compound had little or no effect on growth, whereas a value near -1 means the compound strongly or completely inhibited growth.","F","In vitro",,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,,,,,50347,"N",1,"Autocuration",17,"2","CHEMBL3301548","ORGANISM","Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",0,91,126,,"A Active",1.0,0.36,0.35,0.37,1731000,"ENAMINE","Z56833758"

Each MMV compound (0.1 mM) was tested in minimal media containing dextrose as a carbon source (Yeast Nitrogen Base, Dextrose; YNBD). The growth rate in the presence of each MMV compound was calculated as follows: (i) the first 10 OD readings were averaged and subtracted from all OD readings of the corresponding curve to set the baseline of the growth curve to zero, and (ii) the area under the curve (AUC) was then calculated as the sum of all OD readings. AUC was calculated following 80 OD readings, corresponding to roughly 20 h of growth. A “relative growth” value was calculated as follows: (AUCDRUG – AUCDMSO)/AUCDMSO; where AUCDMSO represents growth measured in a DMSO control well that was on the same microtiter plate of the drug-treated culture. A relative growth value near zero means the compound had little or no effect on growth, whereas a value near -1 means the compound strongly or completely inhibited growth.","F","In vitro",,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,,,,,50347,"N",1,"Autocuration",17,"2","CHEMBL3301548","ORGANISM","Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",0,81,349,,"A Active",1.0,0.41,0.36,0.44,5633666,"ENAMINE","Z56833764"

Each MMV compound (0.1 mM) was tested in minimal media containing ethanol and glycerol as carbon sources (Yeast Nitrogen Base, Ethanol, Glycerol; YNBEG). The growth rate in the presence of each MMV compound was calculated as follows: (i) the first 10 OD readings were averaged and subtracted from all OD readings of the corresponding curve to set the baseline of the growth curve to zero, and (ii) the area under the curve (AUC) was then calculated as the sum of all OD readings. AUC was calculated following 180 OD readings, corresponding to roughly 45 h of growth. A “relative growth” value was calculated as follows: (AUCDRUG – AUCDMSO)/AUCDMSO; where AUCDMSO represents growth measured in a DMSO control well that was on the same microtiter plate of the drug-treated culture.

Each MMV compound (0.1 mM) was tested in minimal media containing dextrose as a carbon source (Yeast Nitrogen Base, Dextrose; YNBD). The growth rate in the presence of each MMV compound was calculated as follows: (i) the first 10 OD readings were averaged and subtracted from all OD readings of the corresponding curve to set the baseline of the growth curve to zero, and (ii) the area under the curve (AUC) was then calculated as the sum of all OD readings. AUC was calculated following 80 OD readings, corresponding to roughly 20 h of growth. A “relative growth” value was calculated as follows: (AUCDRUG – AUCDMSO)/AUCDMSO; where AUCDMSO represents growth measured in a DMSO control well that was on the same microtiter plate of the drug-treated culture. A relative growth value near zero means the compound had little or no effect on growth, whereas a value near -1 means the compound strongly or completely inhibited growth.","F","In vitro",,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,,,,,50347,"N",1,"Autocuration",17,"2","CHEMBL3301548","ORGANISM","Saccharomyces cerevisiae",4932,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae",0,91,349,,"A Active",1.0,0.41,0.36,0.44,5633666,"ENAMINE","Z56833764"
